# Application-of-Deep-Neural-Networks-to-Political-Survey-Data-from-the-2016-US-Presidential-Elections
Machine Learning in Economics course Project at NYU (Spring 2018)

We use a multiple-layer perceptron (deep neural network) to predict which voters
will vote against their affiliated political party. Our dataset is an exit poll of approx-
imately 8,000 voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential election which includes a broad set
of opinion and demographic responses. We find that it is relatively easy to predict
who a person will vote for, but it is much harder to predict whether a voter will
vote for or against their affiliated party even after accounting for their policy and
ideological positions.
